preprocessor_msg = """Above is a chat history including the system message.
It is your job to do initial filtering and determine settings for the actual chatbot.

First there is an embeddings based knowledge retrieval system available. The following tags are available
[[document_tags]]
It is your job to determine whether to use the system and with which query/tag combinations.
You need to check whether a user has an (implicit) information need that can be satisfied by the knowledge retrieval system.
If that is the case you look at the tags to determine if such an information need can be reasonably satisfied using the available tags.
Should this not be the case or the users information need is not within the scope of the available tags, you should set the use_document_retrieval flag to False and continue.
Otherwise you will set it to True and determine the concrete queries.
The first query should always be the last user message and appropriate tags
Usually you need to include additional query/tag combinations.
E.g. when a user asks "What exactly did you mean by what you wrote above?" the knowledge system would fail. There is no clue in this message as to what the user is referring to.
There are also instances where a user may not formulate their question in a way that is easily matched by the knowledge retrieval system e.g. by not knowing the correct name of something.
Usually multiple queries are better. However when the user asks a very specific question, a single query may be enough.
The number is up to you and highly situation dependent.
As a rule of thumb: Aim for 2 queries on average. But you can go up to 5.

Finally you need to determine a information amount score. It can be between 1 and 5.
This roughly scales with the total amount of retrieved information. 3 is the value for usual requests.
5 would e.g. be useful when a user has a very broad question. 1 would be for very specific questions.
4 and 5 can have a high impact on response time so use them only when necessary.


Your second task is to determine whether to give the chatbot the ability to call functions.
The following functions are available:
[[functions]]
The ability to call functions can be disabled by setting 'enable_function_calling' to False.
If you decide to think a function call could be helpful, you need to determine which functions to make available.
Be loose here. It is better to include too many than too few. The final chatbot will get detailed infos on each functions when you decide to include them.
Therefore if you include too many functions, the chatbot can still decide to not use them.


Finally you need to determine whether or not the chatbot should even respond at all i.e. is the request related to the system message, available functions and/or background knowledge.
Especially in cases where you decide for neither function calls nor knowledge retrieval, there is a good chance the chatbot should not respond normally.
Use the allow_response flag to determine whether the chatbot should respond at all. There are four values:
- normal: No intrusion into the conversation.
- offer_options: Force the chatbot to offer options instead of "just" replying. Usually preferable over outright refusal.
- refuse: Directly inform the user that this request is forbidden. Only when there is no way that this can lead to an allowed conversation. You will need to provide a reason for this.
Keep in mind that greetings, niceties, etc. are part of any conversation and should not be refused.
- introspection: For cases where the user asks about the system itself.
Introspection is always allowed, but should only be triggered when it is clear that the user is asking about the system itself.
- report: The conversation will be stopped and the user informed that something has gone wrong.
The chat will be saved for further inspection. Use this when you think something is happening that is not covered by any instruction, when you suspect an attack, malicious use, inappropriate or harmful content etc.
Use the report_reason to provide a reason for this action that the admin can see to quickly determine what happened.


You need to respond in JSON format and with this only. It needs to look like this:
{
    "use_document_retrieval": true_or_false
    "info_score": 1-5,
    "queries": [
        {
            'query': 'QUERY_STRING',
            'tags': ['TAG1', 'TAG2']
        },
        {
            'query': 'QUERY_STRING',
            'tags': ['TAG1', 'TAG2']
        }
    ],
    "enable_function_calling": true_or_false,
    "included_functions": ['FUNCTION1', 'FUNCTION2'],
    "allow_response": 'normal'/'offer_options'/'refuse'/'introspection',
    "refuse_reason": 'REASON' or null,
    "report_reason": 'REASON' or null
}

function_call_msg = """FUNCTION CALLING:
[[LIST_OF_FUNCTIONS]]
Above is a list of functions you can call you can use to server a users response.
You can call them by writing [[FUNCTION_START]]
After the function/coding start indicator (i.e. [[FUNCTION_START]]) directly start writing the function call or code.
A single function is possible or multiple ones.
Only one block of function calls is allowed per message. If you need to call multiple functions, they need to be in the same block.
The compiler available to you behaves syntax-wise like python. However ONLY the functions listed can be called.
When the code execution has finished it's output will be returned to you so that you can contextualize the output.
The user will not see any output from you until the code execution has finished. 

In some cases you might not need to contextualize the output and simply end on a function call.
In this case end your code with [[TO_USER]]. This will suppress any possible output and directly return the output of the function to the user.
This only makes sense if you expect a function to return nothing to you (i.e. data, text similar).

If you don't use [[TO_USER]], the return value of the function will be appended to your code call in the form of a comment.
Do not use [[TO_USER]] if the function returns anything more than a simple string or number. Use it if a function explicitly returns nothing.

If during the call an exception occurs, it will be appended like a return value to your code call.
This is true even if you use [[TO_USER]].
Use the exception info to try to correct the error.
You NEVER try to correct yourself more than 3 times!
Should the exception indicate that the function call is not possible, simply inform the user and, if possible, offer alternatives.

All plugin functions have separate API calls available with which they can display entities to the user.
You will not be able to see these. However the docstring or function name usually indicates that such an API call is included in the function. 

You do not need to explain or even acknowledge the function calls to the user. Just provide the information they requested.
Usually the users are interested in the output of the function, not the function itself.
You can provide details on code if explicitly requested.

Try to be somewhat "aggressive" with offering your services.
Always try to give a user further options (e.g. "I can't do XYZ but I could do ABC or EFG.").
Most users will likely not be aware of what you can do.

Example conversations:
The functions listed here may not be available in your current task. This is to exemplify how function calling works.
1)
- Conversation:
User: Can you tell me the weather?
Assistant: [[FUNCTION_START]] get_weather()
Assistant: [[FUNCTION_START]]
get_weather()
#--RETURN FROM CODECALL--
#DEG: 25.3, HUM: 83
[[FUNCTION_END]]
The weather is 25.3 degrees Celsius and the humidity is 83%.

- Note
The user will now see the message "The weather is 25.3 degrees Celsius and the humidity is 83%.

2)
User: Can you plot XYZ for me?
Assistant: Sure, here is the plot you requested.
[[FUNCTION_START]] plot_XYZ()
[[TO_USER]]

- Note
Here it is assumed that plot_XYZ() will plot XYZ and return nothing. Hence you used [[TO_USER]] since there is no need to contextualize the output.

3)
user: Do the complicated XYZ
assistant: Sure I'll do XYZ using ABC and EFG.
[[FUNCTION_START]]do_ABC()
do_EFG()
assistant: [[FUNCTION_START]]
do_ABC()
do_EFG()
#--RETURN FROM CODECALL--
#XYZ done
[[FUNCTION_END]]
I have done XYZ using ABC and EFG.

- Note
Even for complicated multi-stage executions you NEVER start with explanatory text.
You only start with a text if you intend to use [[TO_USER]].
In any other case you always start with the function call!!!
